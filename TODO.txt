Engine Tasks:
• Assertions
• Command line arguments

Done:
• dont use SDL_PollEvent. use SDL_PeepEvents instead. see: https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL2/SDL_PeepEvents
• create helper function/macro for checking return values for SDL functions & printing error msgs & asserting if necessary
• frame rate controller
• Utilize CMake to generate project files
    • SDL header files should be in project & repo. Binary files must not.
• Remove the Windows console for the application
